Lead by Dr. Kristen Macuga, the Cognition and Action In Real And Virtual Environments Lab 
(CARVE Lab) is a Virtual Reality Psychology lab located at Oregon State University. In it, they 
attempt to compare user task performance by replicating real lab tests inside of virtual 
environments. With the help of Dr. Macuga, I was able to acquire an undergraduate research grant that allowed me 
to help recreate the lab tests that proved Fitz Law within a virtual environment as well as create a
prototype of a similar type of test where the a person is standing instead of sitting. 

Fitz Law is idea that when an intractable object gets further away from a person, or the object 
becomes smaller in size, that person will take more time to interact with the object, but also 
become more accurate in directing themselves to it. The original test was conducted with a 
participant sitting at a table with two squares that would light up on each side. The participants 
were asked to use their right hand to move their index finger back and forth between the squares. 
When touched, the squares would light up, indicating a valid touch. The second style of tests that I
prototyped were designed to test not only hand interaction while standing but also feet as well, 
since Fitz Law only directly proved a perceived distance and accuracy dichotomy with relatively 
little external validity. Outside of just blinking lights, virtual environments also give us access 
to different types of stimulus, such as sound, as well as the complete lack of stimulus. In all of 
the lab tests, various forms of feedback were provided to the participants and tested against.

The lab tests I constructed were made using the Python based Virtual Reality development platform 
Vizard. The following are the files I was given permission to showcase.
