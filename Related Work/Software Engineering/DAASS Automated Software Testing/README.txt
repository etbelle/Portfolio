During my internship at Daimler Trucks NA, I was tasked to research how to set up and automate a 
software testing suite for an in house tool called DAASS. Due to intellectual property reasons I 
cannot go into detail about what DAASS does.

What I was able to accomplish while on this internship was a high-fidelity prototype of a python 
based automated testing suite. The suite was successfully maintained by a Jenkins testing server and
I was able to allow for the test loader script to produce both JSON and XML format log files that 
could track both success rates of unit tests as well as code coverage.
 
I do have permission to share with you the following items from my internship:

- A quick-start guide on how to run the automated testing suite.
- A Python Unittest template file that can be used by any developer to create new tests for the 
  testing suite.
- An example DAASS test file that tests some functionality within a DAASS script.
