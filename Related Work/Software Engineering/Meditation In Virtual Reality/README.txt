For my senior capstone project at Oregon State University (OSU), I was tasked with leading a team of 
Computer Science students in prototyping calming Virtual Reality (VR) environments. With the help of
our Intel stakeholders we were given a task to work with a University of Washington (UW) Human 
Centered Design and Engineering Graduate Capstone team to develop a prototype of a product that 
could help relax a user. 

VR can do funny things to a person. One particular thing that it's known for is to take
a person completely out of reality. In doing so, a person can sometimes lose key pieces of 
information such as where the are in the physical world, how much time has passed, and tracking what
people are saying to them outside of the VR environment. Our Intel project sponsor, Mike Premi, had 
a novel idea to take this idea one step further. Specifically, he wanted to use VR to help people 
manage chronic pain. Since VR could help distract from the self, the hypothesis that VR could also 
distract a person from a level of neurological pain, which is part of the self, made sense. Wanting
to make sure the environment was calming, turning it into a meditative experience was a natural 
conclusion. 

Though every piece of the project is detailed within the final report, the following are the key 
bullet-points on the project:

- Project was data driven from user research, conducted by the UW Graduate Capstone Team.
- Weekly online meetings took place with all three teams to discuss scope, progress, future plans 
  and roadblocks.
- Three different concepts were prototyped using the Unity development platform and programmed with 
  the language C#.
   - Two of the concepts were based on different lengths of a meditation audio clip.
   - The third concept was based on the idea of flow, attempting to direct a user to do a continuous
     series of simple actions in order to keep them engaged with the experience.
- The entire project followed a formal software engineering approach.
