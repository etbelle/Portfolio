Oregon State University's Introduction to Information Visualization class had a final class project
where the students were asked to form groups 3-4 members and attempt to formally evaluate an 
academic paper in the field of Information Visualization. With the help of Alannah Oleson, Hannah 
Solorzano, and Zach Lerew, together we were able to evaluate the paper: AmbiguityVis: visualization
of ambiguity in graph layouts by Y. Wang.

In Wang's paper, he and his fellow researchers attempted to create a graph modeling tool that would 
make understanding nodal networked graphs or weighted graphs easier to comprehend when the graphs 
begin to become to complex for the human eye to look at. After my team and I looked over the images 
of the graphs provided by the proposed program, we weren't convinced that the graphs were entirely 
usable to the audience specified by Wang, even after they were supposedly made easier to view. 

To create our written report we completed the following.
- Became more familiar with nodal networks and weighted graphs.
- Created ambiguous graphs using Java Script and applied the proposed algorithmic graphing solutions
  outlined by Wang.
- Presented the proposed unambiguous graphs to a variety of potential users who all had scientific 
  backgrounds and non-of which had exposure to Wangs software.
- Derived improvements to the software based on user feedback.
- Created low-fidelity prototypes of improvements to Wang's program UI, directly relating to the 
  graphs.
